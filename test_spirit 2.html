    <h2>HEADING 2 HERE</h2>

   <p> I found Spiritbox about a year ago when I was mindlessly scrolling through my Instagram feeds and an account that I follow posted a video of the band's main singer, Courtney LaPlante, singing one of their songs in a "live one take performance" (essentially just singing the song in a studio without edits). I was blown away. Courtney's vocals are almost haunting and have an uncanny ability to grab ahold of you. After listening to her performance, I checked the band out and Spiribotx quickly became my favorite new band. CONTINUE TEXT HERE  </p>
